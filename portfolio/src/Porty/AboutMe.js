                    <p class='Aboutp'>Welcome to my website, My name is Adonis Puente. I am a
                        Full Stack Developer who enjoys making ideas come to life.
                        I made this website using React.js and CSS. I'm always trying to
                        explore and figure out new technologies to push the limits of what
                        is possible. When im not coding im usually exercising, looking up vidoes of 
                        recipes I know im never going to make, hanging out with friends/family,
                        or (seldomly) play some video games!
                        </p>

                </div>
